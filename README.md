# Synchronization task


## Getting started

Clone the main branch onto your local system. 
In terminal, cd to this branch and run 
```
cd path_to_this_repo/python_code
python sync_folders.py source replica synchro_log.md 60
```
to test this particular repos' synchronization in the interval of 60 seconds. 

# Synchronizing your own folders
If you wish to synchronize any other folders on your local system, just replace the source and replica paths in the command above with your desired folder paths. 
You can change the log path and interval of synchronization as to any other interval in seconds.
